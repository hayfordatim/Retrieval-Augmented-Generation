To address the increasing demand for accessibility and support for prospective students
I worked on implementing a chatbot using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable these prospect students interact with the bot to acquire information. The primary objectives of implementing the RAG is to enhance user experience, streamline information dissemination, and provide real-time support. In a world increasingly dominated by vast amounts of textual data, the ability to comprehend and generate contextually relevant content has become a paramount challenge. 

Embarking on a journey into the dynamic realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), this project represents a convergence of cutting-edge techniques and class concepts, culminating in a powerful implementation. By seamlessly integrating some class concepts, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLM), Tokenization, Semantic Similarity with Word Embeddings, Automated Classification, and Information Architecture, the project aims to improve the landscape of text generation and information retrieval.

The project unfolds in Python, leveraging TensorFlow and Hugging Face's Transformers library. The entire implementation, including code, documentation, and datasets (knowledge base), resides on GitHub, ensuring accessibility and transparency. The focal point is the implementation of the RAG to generate contextually rich and coherent text.

The initial phase delves into scraping the Masters of Information Management Systems FAQ page (https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mims/admissions/faq ), which was saved in a csv file to allow for easy chunking. The next step was to create the Retrieval Augmented Generation, a paradigm blending information retrieval with generative language models. The objective is to enhance the relevance of generated content by intelligently retrieving information to inform subsequent responses.

Tokenization takes center stage as the bedrock of the project, influencing the granularity of text processing. Meticulous tokenization ensures that input text is accurately represented, setting the foundation for precise and context-aware language generation. The data from the knowledgebase was broken into chunks and converted into embeddings to enable storage in a vector store. This technology leveraged on Facebook’s AI Similarity Search (FAISS).

The project incorporates semantic similarity calculations based on pre-trained word embeddings to enhance the understanding of contextual relationships between words. This addition empowers the model to grasp subtle semantic nuances, contributing to more sophisticated language generation with improved coherence.

Central to the project is the integration of the Large Language Model (LLM), using a model from Meta’s LLaMA 2 (meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf) exemplified by llama. Trained on extensive datasets, LLaMA 2 discerns intricate patterns and relationships, promising a new level of natural and contextually aware text generation, surpassing traditional language models in fluency and coherence.

Leveraging on the class concept on automated classification I realized it plays a pivotal role in categorizing input text, a critical task for context-specific response generation. Utilizing supervised learning techniques, the model learns to predict categories based on input text, ensuring more targeted and contextually relevant responses.

Guided by principles of information architecture, the project orchestrates the organization and structuring of textual information. A coherent and intuitive flow is crafted, ensuring that generated content is not only contextually relevant but also presented in a user-friendly manner.

The entire project, from its intricacies to inner workings, is documented and housed within a structured GitHub repository. This decision aligns with the project's commitment to transparency and knowledge sharing. The repository structure facilitates seamless navigation, enabling users to understand, replicate, and extend the project with ease.

Each class concept plays a pivotal role in shaping the architecture and functionality of the project. The synergy between RAG and LLM ensures the generation of responses aligned with retrieved information, exhibiting linguistic fluency and coherence. Tokenization, as a preprocessing step, sets the stage for semantic similarity calculations, enhancing the model's contextual understanding. Automated classification guides the model toward contextually relevant response generation, while information architecture provides a structured framework for organizing and presenting textual information.

As the curtains draw on this project, it stands as a testament to the power of advanced NLP techniques. By incorporating RAG, LLM, tokenization, semantic similarity, automated classification, and information architecture, the project achieves not only its technical objectives but also contributes to the broader discourse on language models and information processing.

In conclusion, the project not only showcases technical prowess but also embodies a commitment to continuous improvement, collaboration, and the responsible application of advanced NLP technologies. It stands as a milestone in the journey of transforming class concepts into tangible implementations, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in the dynamic field of Natural Language Processing.
