After you submit your application, our system will not allow you to directly upload additional materials.

"I am considering eventually pursuing a Ph.D. Should I apply to the MIMS program first, as preparation for the Ph.D.? The MIMS program is not intended to serve as preparation for our Ph.D. program. The MIMS program is intended to teach the skills necessary for professional practice in various information-related careers; the Ph.D. program, on the other hand, is designed to prepare you for an academic or research career."
"My academic institution is not listed in the drop down menu in the Academic History section. What should I do? If you cannot find your academic institution in the drop down menu, try typing in a unique word from your institution name to check if that automatically populates the institution. If that does not work, you may manually write in your institution name. You must include “Dates Attended” to save the academic institution to your application."
"My GPA is not on a 4.0 scale. Do I need to convert it or submit a GPA calculation worksheet? No, instead of converting your GPA to a 4.0 scale, please leave the ""Grade Point Averages (GPA)"" field (under ""Grades”) blank. Our admissions committee is knowledgeable about international transcripts and how to evaluate grades and performance."
"My grades were impacted by COVID-19 or changed to a P/NP grading policy. How will the I School review these grades? The I School evaluates applications holistically, meaning that we consider an applicant’s combination of professional, academic, and personal experiences and accomplishments, letters of recommendation, statements, and academic record in our admissions decisions. Such a review takes into account the significant disruptions of COVID-19 when reviewing students’ transcripts and other admissions materials. And we understand that many institutions across the country instituted P/NP grading policies during Spring 2020."
"Do I need to upload official transcripts with my application? No, you may submit unofficial transcripts (scanned copies or screenshots). Unofficial transcripts must include your full name, grades, cumulative GPA, degree conferred/awarded information, and institution name. If you are admitted to the MIMS program and decide to enroll, UC Berkeley Graduate Division will require that you submit official documents in your first term."
"What if I am currently in school or have not completed my degree? Please upload your current unofficial transcripts to your application. Your unofficial transcripts must include grades from your most recently completed semester/quarter. If you are admitted to the MIMS program and decide to enroll, UC Berkeley Graduate Division will require that you submit official transcripts and degree certificates/conferral (if applicable) that include degree awarded/conferred information. Per UC Berkeley Graduate Division eligibility requirements, you must complete your undergraduate degree before you are eligible to begin MIMS."
"Do I need to submit a degree certificate/conferral? If your transcript does not include official evidence of your awarded degree, you must submit additional documents that verify your degree conferral. Institutions from the following countries must submit a bachelor’s degree certificate/conferral with their transcripts: China, India, Pakistan, Iran, and most European and Latin American countries."
"Do I need to submit a degree certificate/conferral? For applicants with degrees from China: UC Berkeley Graduate Division accepts English-only transcripts, but requires that you submit degree certificates/conferrals in both Chinese and English (translated directly from the academic institution or an ATA-certified translator)."

How do I know if my recommenders have submitted their letters of recommendation? You will receive an email after your recommender has completed and submitted their letter. You can also confirm receipt by checking your application status page.
"My recommenders did not receive a link. How do I proceed? This is a common issue for recommenders who have business email addresses that filter out .edu email addresses. Ask your recommender to check their spam folder for an email from gradadm@berkeley.edu. If they cannot find the email, you have two options: 1) Go back into your application and choose to “exclude” your recommender. Then, re-enter the recommender information, using their personal email address. 2) Email their name(s) to us at admissions@ischool.berkeley.edu, and we will send them a personal email link."
"How do I follow up with my recommenders? After sending the initial invitation to your recommenders, you may send reminder emails via the “Recommendations” page which you can find linked at the bottom of your application status page. You may continue to send reminders after you submit your application."
"Can I submit my application if my recommenders have not yet submitted their letters? Yes, you may submit your application before your letters of recommendation have been submitted."
Can I add recommendations after I have submitted my application? You may add recommenders if you have not already had three letters submitted to your application. You can add recommenders via the “Recommendations” page linked at the bottom of your application status page.
"Can we use a personal email address for our recommender? Yes, if your recommender can no longer access their business email address, you may enter their personal email address."
"Can I use Interfolio for my recommendations? Yes, Interfolio will provide you with a specific email address for each letter that can be entered into the recommendation field."
"Am I required to submit a GRE or GMAT score with my application? No, the GRE/GMAT exam is no longer an application requirement. If you have not yet taken the GRE/GMAT, we recommend that you put your time and effort towards the required application materials that better reflect your aptitude, strengths, and fit. Read more about our decision to drop the GRE/GMAT here."
"If I self-reported a GRE or GMAT score in my application, do I need to send an official report via ETS or GMAC? Yes, if you would like your self-reported scores to be evaluated, you must officially report your scores to UC Berkeley via the institution code 4833. The official report may take up to 10–15 days to transfer into our system."
"My GRE or GMAT score report shows “awaiting” on my application checklist, but I already sent it to 4833. Have you received it? GRE and GMAT score reports take 10-15 days to transfer into our application system. If it has been over 15 days and your status still shows “awaiting,” please contact us at admissions@ischool.berkeley.edu, and we will conduct a manual search for your score report."
"What is the Programming Proficiency Form? Entering MIMS students must have a basic level of skill in object-oriented programming in order to be well prepared for success.

While you are not required to submit evidence of completed coursework, it could be in your best interest to do so, especially for candidates with limited programming or technical experience. Please upload documentation to the last question of the Programming Proficiency Form. Please also be sure to list on the Programming Proficiency Form specific coursework that you have completed or that is in progress."
"Do I need to submit writing samples or publications and presentations to the Supporting Materials section of the application?

Because of the variety of international education systems, there is no single answer. For specific questions, please contact admissions@ischool.berkeley.edu."
"Do I need to submit financial documents with my application? No. Please do not send bank statements or other financial documents with your application. If you are admitted, the Berkeley International Office will contact you to request additional financial documentation."

For the TOEFL exam, the school code for UC Berkeley is 4833 and the department code for the I School is 99.
